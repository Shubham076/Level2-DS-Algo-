/*

Given an array arr[] consisting of N positive integers representing the lengths of N ropes and a positive integer K,
the task is to find the maximum length of the rope that has a frequency of at least K by cutting
any ropes in any number of pieces.

algo:
Find the mid-value of the range [low, high] and store it in a variable say mid.
Traverse the array arr[] and find the count of ropes of length mid that can be obtained by cutting the ropes and 
store it in a variable say, count.
If the value of count is at least K, then update the value of mid as ans and update the value of low as (mid + 1).
Otherwise, update the value of high as (mid â€“ 1).
